    <h2>Bench Press: Basics and alternatives</h2>
    <p>
      The bench press is a crucial core exercise not only in bodybuilding but also in various other strength-related sports[1]. While lying on a flat bench, you press a barbell vertically upwards from your chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exercise is excellent for selectively targeting chest muscles, making it a staple in nearly every training plan. Bench press, squats, and deadlifts together constitute powerlifting.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several variations of the bench press, such as: Dumbbell Bench Press, Incline Bench Press, and Negative Bench Press.
    </p>

    <h2>Correct execution</h2>
    <p>
      Although the bench press is a common exercise, it’s often done incorrectly. Mistakes can be made in the lying position, shoulder position, grip, lowering position, and movement sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re new to bench pressing, start with just the barbell without weights. This way, you’ll quickly learn the movement as a beginner, without much risk of injury.
    </p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      1.Lie on the flat bench with your back. The barbell bar in the holder should be at about eye level.<br>
      2.Keep your feet firmly on the ground. At the gym, some people lift their legs or place their feet on the bench, but you should avoid this. Keeping your feet on the ground provides the best stability.<br>
      3.Retract your shoulder blades.<br>
      4.Press your feet onto the floor and tense your lower back. That way you form a slight hollow back – the so-called “bridge”.<br>
      5.Extend your arms straight up and reach for the barbell. Then, move your hands outward by one hand width. Your grip should now be slightly wider than shoulder-width. A grip that’s too narrow will focus more on the triceps and less on the pectoral muscles, while a grip that’s too wide will activate the shoulder more. However, the optimal grip depends on your individual physique.<br>
      6.When gripping the barbell, your thumb should wrap around the bar for safety. Don’t use the so-called monkey grip (see below).<br>
      7.Lift the barbell bar out of the rack. Avoid bending your wrists too much.<br>
      8.Lower the bar evenly above your chest, not too fast. Keep your elbows directed downwards, towards your feet, rather than spreading them outwards to the sides. Keep your shoulder blades tucked in during the entire movement. Inhale as you lower the bar.<br>
      9.The exact spot where the barbell lands when you lower it depends on your individual anatomy. For some, it’s around nipple level, while for others it’s slightly above or below. Make sure not to lower the bar too close to your neck.<br>
      10.Opinions differ on whether the bar should touch your chest or not. As long as you don’t rest the weight on your body or use momentum to bounce it off your chest, it shouldn’t matter too much.<br>
      11.Perform the upward movement as quickly and evenly as possible, exhaling as you do so.<br>
      12.Once at the top, maintain body tension, avoid fully extending your arms, and repeat.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Common mistakes and injuries</h2>
    <p>Avoid lowering the weight too quickly. You should bring the bar back up as quickly as possible, but you must not bounce it off your chest with momentum. Not only can this cause injury, but it also reduces the overall impact compared to performing the exercise correctly.<br><br>
      Ensure you maintain the correct posture for your elbows and shoulders/shoulder blades, as described above. Otherwise, excessive stress may be placed on the joints, which can be problematic in the long run. Performing the exercise incorrectly also reduces the training effect on the chest muscles.</p>
